# Decision-Tree-Classification ðŸŒ³

A full implementation of a decision tree classifier in Python from scratch.
That tree predicts if a certain day is going to be busy or NOT in Seoul Bike rental.

<h3> main idea: </h3>
Creating a decision tree using enthropy to figuer the order of the nodes in the root.

After the tree creation, each node has a statistical significance by performing Chi-square pruning 

K-fold Cross-Validation responsible of saving all error values and print the average when process is done

Eventually try to predict the calssification of record, that is not a part of the train or testing data, using a decision tree.
